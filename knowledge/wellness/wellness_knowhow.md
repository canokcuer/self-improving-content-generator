## The Founder's Story: Ersin Pamuksuzer

Ersin Pamuksuzer was so impressed with the benefits of detoxing that he wanted to share it with the world. After 20 successful years in the fast-paced business world, then 46 year-old founder of TheLifeCo started looking for a new way of living when he joined his first detoxification program in 2002.

**Results he experienced:**
- Increased energy
- Loss of excess weight
- Clearer eyes and skin
- Better sleep
- Easier digestion
- Improved mood
- Clearer state of mind

He realized that he could make noticeable changes in the way he felt and his level of health with minor adjustments to his eating, thinking and exercising habits, and his environment. By word of mouth this wellness concept gained so much popularity that he decided to form a company to share his experiences and resources with other people interested in discovering a healthier way of life.

## Quality of Life & The Mismatch

### What is Well-being?

"Well-being" is achieving the highest level of life quality and maintaining it in order to enjoy your life with optimum vitality and functionality.

**Optimum Health = The best possible level of health a person can achieve**

### The Wellness Gap

The gap between the optimum health line and actual life curve is called the "wellness gap" or "healing potential." This gap exists due to the mismatch in our lives - namely in the areas of:

- **Food**
- **Mind**
- **Movement**
- **Environment**

### Living in the 21st Century

The world we are living in is different to the one we are actually supposed to be living in:

| Originally Designed | 21st Century Reality |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Nutritious Foods | Products |
| Calm | Stressed |
| Natural Environment | Man-made Environment |
| Dynamic Lifestyle | Sedentary Lifestyle |

### The Mismatch Consequences

Mismatch causes:
1. **Deficiency** - Body can't get needed nutrients
2. **Toxemia** - Toxic buildup in the body
3. **Chronic Stress** - Constant fight-or-flight mode

These three outcomes reduce our life qualities, cause burnout syndrome, and increase the possibility of chronic diseases.

> Chronic diseases are the primary cause of deaths in the world, representing 93% of all deaths.

---

## Deficiency

The body needs specific nutritional input in order to operate and function. However, the state of deficiency occurs when nutrition needs of body are not met.

**Today's food problems:**
- Nutrition undergoes deterioration due to commercialization
- Lengthening shelf times
- Production techniques
- Cooking processes

Despite being consumed enough, due to the changes in food content, we can't get most of the nutritional elements from the food we eat. Even though we eat more than enough, we don't get sufficient nutrients and continue to be hungry.

---

## Toxemia

There are two main reasons that toxins gather in the body:

1. Body's exposure to unnatural environmental toxins in food, air and water
2. Inability to excrete as much as necessary toxins because of unhealthy personal habits, tiredness and a weakened nervous system

These reasons lead to Toxemia. The extra toxicity counterworks the body's natural immune system and creates a body environment suitable for illnesses.

---

## Chronic Stress

### The Autonomic Nervous System

| System | Mode | Function |
|--------|------|----------|
| **Sympathetic** | Fight or Flight | Protects and survives |
| **Parasympathetic** | Rest and Digest | Repairs, renews, restores |

In today's world we face numerous unjustified triggers, keeping us constantly in sympathetic mode (flight and fight mode), withholding rejuvenation and healing from occurring.

### The Problem
Modern and stressful city life causes us to live under chronic stress leading us to live our lives in a 24/7 flight & fight mode. This puts our immune system at risk, stops rejuvenation, and invites chronic diseases into our bodies.

---

## Products vs Food & Nutrition

### The Diet Pyramid

**From Bottom to Top (most to least consumption):**

## The Mind & Mindfulness

### Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Skills

Four critical skills for emotional wellness:
1. **Mindfulness** - Being fully present
2. **Emotion Regulation** - Managing emotional responses
3. **Distress Tolerance** - Coping with difficult situations
4. **Interpersonal Effectiveness** - Healthy relationships

### What is Mindfulness?

> Being mindful is to be fully present with your direct experience of the moment. Fully present with whatever you are doing, thinking or feeling. HERE AND NOW.

### Mindful Attitudes

| Attitude | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Non-Judging** | Observing without constantly generating judgments |
| **Patience** | Understanding that things unfold in their own time |
| **Beginner's Mind** | Experiencing everything as if for the first time |
| **Trust** | Developing basic trust in yourself and your feelings |
| **Acceptance** | Seeing things as they actually are in the present |
| **Letting Go** | Cultivating non-attachment |

---

## Autopilot Mode

In our complicated environment, we spend most of our time living by autopilot mode. When we slip into autopilot mode, our attention is absorbed in our wandering minds and we are not really 'present' in our own lives.

**Consequences of autopilot mode:**
- Failing to notice the beauty of life
- Failing to hear what our bodies are telling us
- Getting stuck in mechanical, conditioned ways of thinking
- Vulnerability to anxiety, stress, depression

> Research shows that the more our minds ponder, the less happy we become.

---

## Fight or Flight Mode vs Rejuvenating Mode

### Fight or Flight
The body perceives any trigger as a life-threatening danger. Blood fueled by cortisol and glucose is pumped to the arms and legs. Our bodies are not supposed to be in this mode continuously.

### Rejuvenating Mode
The mode in which body is totally relaxed and focused on repairing and recreating itself. Humans are supposed to have only few moments of stress during a regular day and rejuvenate in between.

---

## Brain Waves & State of Mind

| Frequency | Wave | State |
|-----------|------|-------|
| 40-200 Hz | **Gamma** | Higher consciousness |
| 13-40 Hz | **Beta** | Alert, focused, problem-solving |
| 7-13 Hz | **Alpha** | "Power of now," calmness, learning |
| 4-7 Hz | **Theta** | Deep meditation, learning, memory |
| 0-4 Hz | **Delta** | Deepest meditation, healing, regeneration |

**Goal:** Being mindful requires being mostly in low frequency waves such as Alpha and Theta.

---

## Reference Frame

Our reference frame is built from:
- Genetic structure from parents
- Family environment
- Dominant culture and religion
- Schooling and education
- Working environment
- Social life and experiences

The reference frame and our environment determine how we read the world. All our behaviors, character and identity are formed as result of these combinations.

> Changing formations like habits can take years.

---

## Action vs Reaction

**Mindfulness is being aware of ourselves, others, our choices and actions.**

| Reaction | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Sporadic and emotional | Balanced with rational thinking |
| Autopilot mode | Conscious decision making |
| Not mindful | Mindful |

> There is a space between the trigger and response. In that space lies our power to choose our response.

---

## Mindset

Mindset is composed of Mind, Body & Spirit - these three form the basis of everything.

### Developing a Growth Mindset

| Instead of... | Try thinking... |
|---------------|-----------------|
| I'm not good at this | What am I missing? |
| I give up | I'll use a different strategy |
| It's good enough | Is this really my best work? |
| I can't make this any better | I can always improve |
| This is too hard | This may take some time |
| I made a mistake | Mistakes help me to learn |
| I just can't do this | I am going to train my brain |
| I'll never be that smart | I will learn how to do this |
| Plan A didn't work | There's always Plan B |
| My friends can do it | I will learn from them |

---

## Mind-Body-Spirit Connection

| Component | Role | Elements |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **Body** | Learning Tool | Systems, organs, cells, brain, 5 senses |
| **Mind** | Creator | Personality, will, conscious, subconscious |
| **Spirit** | Observer | Love, meaning, purpose |

When we are in balance or alignment, we are able to experience joy from everything we do. We can think of the body as a learning tool for the mind and spirit.
