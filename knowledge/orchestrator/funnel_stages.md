# Marketing Funnel Stages for TheLifeCo Content

This guide helps the Orchestrator Agent detect and optimize content for the appropriate marketing funnel stage.

## Overview

Every piece of content should be aligned with where the target audience is in their customer journey. The four stages are:

1. **Awareness** - They don't know they need us yet
2. **Consideration** - They're researching options
3. **Conversion** - They're ready to book
4. **Loyalty** - They're past guests

## Funnel Stage Detection Questions

To determine funnel stage, the Orchestrator should consider:

   - Past guests → Loyalty

2. **What's the goal?**
   - Educate/inspire → Awareness
   - Differentiate/explain → Consideration
   - Drive action/book → Conversion
   - Retain/refer → Loyalty

3. **Is there a specific offer?**
   - No offer → Awareness or Consideration
   - Yes, with pricing/deadline → Conversion
   - Loyalty reward/referral → Loyalty

4. **What action do we want?**
   - Follow/engage → Awareness
   - Learn more/download → Consideration
   - Book/buy → Conversion
   - Share/refer → Loyalty

## Cross-Funnel Considerations

### Content Can Serve Multiple Stages
Some content can work across stages with slight modifications:
- A testimonial can be awareness (inspiration) or conversion (proof)
- A program explanation can be consideration (education) or conversion (selling)

### Always Ask for Clarity
When unsure, ask: "Is this content meant to educate new audiences, help people decide, drive immediate bookings, or engage past guests?"
