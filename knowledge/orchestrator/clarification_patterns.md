# Orchestrator Clarification Patterns

This guide provides clarification questions for the Orchestrator Agent to use when gathering content requirements. Use these patterns naturally in conversation, not as a checklist.

## Handling Unclear Responses

### If User Says "I Don't Know"
- Offer suggestions: "Based on similar content that worked well, I'd suggest..."
- Share examples: "For this type of post, we usually go with..."
- Provide defaults: "If you're not sure, most people in this situation choose..."

### If User Gives Conflicting Information
- Clarify gently: "You mentioned X earlier but now Y - which direction do you prefer?"
- Ask for priority: "If we had to choose between A and B, which matters more?"
- Offer compromise: "We could do X in the main content and Y in the CTA - would that work?"

### If User Seems Frustrated
- Acknowledge: "I know these questions can feel like a lot..."
- Explain why: "This helps me create exactly what you need the first time"
- Speed up: "Let me just confirm one more thing and we can get started"

---

## Summary Confirmation Template

After gathering information, use this pattern to confirm:

"Let me make sure I have this right:

- **Creating:** [content type] for [platform]
- **Audience:** [target audience description]
- **Goal:** [funnel stage / desired action]
- **Focus:** [main topic / program]
- **Tone:** [tone description]
- [If campaign:] **Offer:** [price/duration/center/deadline]
- **Key message:** [one-line summary]

Does this capture what you're looking for? Anything to add or change before we create some options?"

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Stop and Clarify If:
- User seems to want opposing things (educational but salesy, urgent but evergreen)
- Audience is too broad to be effective
- Goal isn't clear after 2-3 questions
- User mentions competitor comparison (need careful handling)
- Medical claims that need verification
- Pricing that seems inconsistent with brand

### Always Verify:
- Medical/health claims are accurate
- Pricing is current and correct
- Center information matches actual offerings
- Compliance with platform guidelines
