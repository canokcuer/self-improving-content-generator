## Instagram

### Algorithm Priorities (2025)

Top 3 ranking factors:
1. **Watch Time** - How long people view your content
2. **Likes per Reach** - Engagement rate matters more than total likes
3. **DM Shares** - The strongest signal for reaching new audiences

### Feed Posts

**Specifications:**
- Image: 1080x1080px (square) or 1080x1350px (portrait - better performing)
- Caption: Up to 2,200 characters (first 125 visible before "more")
- Hashtags: 3-5 highly relevant (fewer is now better than 30)

**Best Practices:**
- Lead with faces - posts with people outperform everything else
- Front-load important information in first two lines
- Use line breaks for readability
- End with a question or CTA to boost comments

**Hashtag Strategy:**
- Mix of branded (#TheLifeCo), niche (#WellnessRetreat), and broad (#Health)
- Place in caption (not comments) for best reach
- Rotate hashtag sets to avoid appearing spammy

### Reels

**Specifications:**
- Length: 30-60 seconds optimal (can be up to 90 seconds)
- Aspect ratio: 9:16 (vertical)
- Hook: First 1-3 seconds critical

**Best Practices:**
- Use original audio or trending audio
- Add text overlays for muted viewing (85% watch without sound)
- Don't use TikTok watermarks (reduces distribution)
- Include face in first frame
- Avoid "salesy" content - educational/entertaining performs better

**Content Types That Perform:**
- Educational ("3 signs your body needs a detox")
- Behind-the-scenes at centers
- Guest transformation stories (with permission)
- Quick wellness tips
- "Day in the life" at TheLifeCo

### Stories

**Specifications:**
- 1080x1920px (9:16 ratio)
- Up to 60 seconds per story
- Multiple segments should total 3-7 stories

**Best Practices:**

- Use polls, quizzes, and questions for engagement
- Place important text in center (edges may be cut off)
- Add link stickers for CTAs
- Use countdown for program launches

### Carousels

**Specifications:**
- Up to 20 images/videos per carousel
- 1080x1350px recommended for all slides
- Can mix images and video clips

**Best Practices:**
- Educational carousels perform exceptionally well (10%+ engagement)
- Strong hook on first slide
- Each slide should provide value
- Last slide = strong CTA
- Use consistent visual theme

### Content Restrictions

Instagram limits distribution of:
- Health misinformation
