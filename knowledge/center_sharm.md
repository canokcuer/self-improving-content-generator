## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I continue taking medication during the cleanse?
We never recommend stopping medication during a cleanse as it can be dangerous. Our Detox & Wellbeing consultants will guide you with the best choices.

### Can I cleanse if I have Diabetes?
Yes. Type-2 diabetes can be reversed by modifying diet and lifestyle. Duration of 7-21 days is recommended; 7 days balances hormones and blood sugar, 14+ days for complete impact.

### Can I join the program if I'm menstruating?
Yes, participating in a cleansing program is no problem. Any extreme change in diet can affect your menstrual cycle.

### Can I cleanse if I'm taking anti-depressants?
Yes, you can.

### Can I detox if I am slim?
Yes, as long as you are not suffering from an eating disorder, malnutrition, or certain deficiencies. If drastically underweight, healthy nutrition programs are recommended.

### Can I cleanse if I am pregnant?
Healthy Nutritional Programs are suitable for pregnant guests. The program manager will assist in choosing the most suitable program.

### Is there a doctor on-site?
Yes. You will have a consultation with the holistic doctor/practitioner upon arrival and receive guidance from the detox & wellbeing consultant.

### What about high blood pressure or high cholesterol?
Many guests come specifically for these issues. Blood pressure is checked daily. Fasting usually reduces high blood pressure, but never stop medication. Cleansing helps with cholesterol by cleaning the blood and liver.

### Do I need to do a pre-detox?
Yes, pre-cleansing is important. Without it, you may experience stronger "detox symptoms" (headaches, dizziness, nausea). If you arrive without pre-detox, green detox programs can help transition.

### What should I bring?
Comfortable clothing for yoga/meditation, sports shoes for walking, sun cream, swimsuit, and a good book. Raincoat or umbrella for wet season.

### Gift certificates
Available - can be sent to friends after payment.

### Special occasions
One massage offered as a gift for birthdays, anniversaries, etc.
