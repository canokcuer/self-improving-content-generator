## TheLifeCo Method Overview

TheLifeCo Method is the foundation of TheLifeCo's approach to wholistic wellness. Clients "buy into" the method, not just a menu of treatments.

### The Two-Layer Foundation

| Layer | Focus | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Layer 1** | Autophagy, Cleansing, Detoxing | Physical reset foundation |
| **Layer 2** | Mental Reset & Mental Wellness | Psychological transformation |

These two layers form the core of ALL TheLifeCo programs. Personalization happens by combining these base layers with therapies and treatments from the service menu.

### Core Principles of The Method

1. **Wholistic Approach**: The whole is more than bits and pieces
2. **Result Oriented**: Measurable transformation
3. **Plant-Based**: All diet programs are plant-based
4. **No Harm Basis**: Safe, natural approaches
5. **Natural Medicine**: Rather than pharmaceutical drugs
6. **Lifetime Partnership**: Pre-During-Post support

### Three Positioning Options

#### Primary: "Accessible Clinical Wellness"
> TheLifeCo is the accessible path to clinically guided wellness — a place where people achieve real, measurable transformation without the ultra-luxury price tag.

#### Secondary: "Science-Backed Wellness Without Barriers"
> TheLifeCo blends evidence-based wellness, medical oversight, and restorative environments to create a science-informed retreat experience that's more approachable, more personal, and more transformative than its luxury counterparts.

**Use when**: Moving up-market, "East meets West" positioning.

- Behavior change as treatment
- Integration of care (not just diet + exercise)
- Stress management, sleep, social support, environment, habit change
