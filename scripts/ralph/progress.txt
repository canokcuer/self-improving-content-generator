Project: TheLifeCo Self-Improving Content Marketing Assistant

## Codebase Patterns
- Virtual environment: source .venv/bin/activate
- Quality checks: ruff check content_assistant/ tests/ && pytest tests/ -v -k 'not integration'
- Detailed implementation specs are in PLAN.md (read the relevant story section before implementing)
- Use Python 3.13+ features where appropriate
- All modules should have proper docstrings and type hints
- Tests go in tests/ directory, mirroring the package structure
- Environment variables loaded from .env file using python-dotenv
